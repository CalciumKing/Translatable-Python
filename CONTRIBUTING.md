# CONTRIBUTING

This project was developed by two friends.
Contributions are welcome! This repo is collaborative,
so if you want to add a solution in a new language or just
improve some code that you think that can be improved, follow these steps:


## 1. Fork it

You can get your own fork/copy of [Translatable Python](https://github.com/CalciumKing/Translatable-Python) by using the Fork button.

## 2. Start coding!

Once you have forked the repo, modify `lang.csv` with your language's keywords,
and make some example programs in a dedicated folder inside `examples/`.
Once your program compiles correctly, move your updated `lang.csv` file to
your new folder and rename `lang.csv` to an abbreviation of your language
with the `.csv` file extension. Ex: `ru.csv` or `thai.csv`.

For a PR to be approved and merged please note:

- After modifying `lang.csv` and creating your custom file, revert `lang.csv`
back to its original state for future users to use.
- Do not add more files to the project root, add files to their
own language folder inside `examples/`.
- Do not delete folders/files

## 3. Ready, Steady, Go...
