# Gen Alpha Programming (GAP)

Gen Alpha Programming (GAP) is a fun, experimental Python-like language that uses Gen Alpha slang for its syntax.  It's designed as a demonstration of how a simple interpreter can be built and to provide a humorous take on programming languages.  It is *not* intended for serious software development, but rather as an educational and entertaining project.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified interpreter, *not* a full compiler.  It translates GAP code into standard Python and then executes it.  This means it has limitations compared to a fully compiled language.

## Installation

You don't need to "install" anything special.  Just make sure you have Python 3 (preferably 3.10 or later, for `match`/`case` support) installed on your system.  Then, save the interpreter code (provided in the `genalpha_python.py` file) to your computer.

## Running GAP Code

There are two ways to run GAP code:

1.  **Interactive Mode:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the interpreter script:

    ```bash
    python gena.py
    ```

    You'll see a `gap> ` prompt.  Type your GAP code line by line, and it will be executed immediately.  Type `exit` to quit the interactive mode.  Multi-line statements (like `if`, `for`, `while`, and function definitions) are supported; the interpreter will wait for the complete block (indicated by a colon at the end of the initial line) before executing.

2.  **File Input:**

    Create a text file containing your GAP code (e.g., `my_program.gap`).  Then, run the interpreter with the filename as an argument:

    ```bash
    python gena.py my_program.gap
    ```

    The interpreter will read and execute the code from the file.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Indentation:** GAP, like Python, uses indentation (4 spaces recommended) to define code blocks (e.g., inside `if`, `for`, `while`, and function definitions).
*   **Functions:**  Functions are defined using `skibidi function_name(arguments) lbrace ...`.  The `bussin` keyword is used for a very basic form of return (see limitations below).
* **Strings:** Strings are supported using the `rant` keyword.

**Limitations:**

*   **Simplified Interpreter:** This is *not* a full-featured programming language.  It's a demonstration project.
*   **Limited `return`:** The `bussin` keyword provides only very basic return functionality.  It works primarily for simple expressions at the top level (outside of functions) and stores the "returned" value in a special variable.  It doesn't handle complex return scenarios within nested functions.
*   **No Classes:**  Object-oriented programming features (classes, objects, methods) are not supported.
*   **No Modules/Imports:** There's no support for importing external modules.
*   **Limited Error Handling:** The error messages might not always be very helpful, especially if the error is caused by the underlying Python code generated by the interpreter.
*   **Global Scope Only:**  All variables are in a single global scope.  There's no concept of local variables within functions (beyond function parameters).
* **No Type Enforcement** Type Hints like `rizz` are replaced but python does not enforce them.

**Example Program (example.gap):**
```Example.gap
skibidi greet(yap name) lbrace
print("Hello, " plus name plus "!")

skibidi factorial(rizz n) lbrace
edgy n equals_equals 0 lbrace
bussin 1
amogus lbrace
bussin n times factorial(n minus 1)

rizz num equals 5
rizz fact equals factorial(num)
print("Factorial of " plus str(num) plus " is " plus str(fact)) # Convert numbers to strings for printing

greet("World")

flex i in range(1, 6) lbrace # Loop from 1 to 5
print("Current number: " plus str(i))

goon W lbrace #Infinite loop
rant user_input = input("Enter a number (or 'quit' to exit): ")
edgy user_input equals_equals "quit" lbrace
bruh
amogus:
rizz number = int(user_input)
print("You entered: " plus str(number))
rbrace
